# SnevenTracker

SnevenTracker (SN76489 Tracker) is a fork of FamiTracker version 0.4.6 that emulates the Texas Instruments SN76489 sound chip, which is used in a wide variety of computers and gaming consoles. The project's ultimate aim is to support multiple sound chips in a more modular manner than 0.4.6, and then forward-port these changes to [0CC-FamiTracker](https://github.com/HertzDevil/0CC-FamiTracker).

As in 0CC-FT, all changes to the source code are marked with `// // //`.

See `NOTES.md` for a brief overview of the stuffs actually added.

### To-do

- Should support multiple master clock rates and both versions of the LFSR
- Should support all sound chips as described in the notes
- KSS export is planned, but low priority
